User requires function signatures to be on a single line when possible, rather than split across multiple lines. This applies to all projects and all function/method definitions.

Preferred format:
    def parse_video_folder(cls, folder_path: Path, video_extensions: List[str] = ['.mp4', '.avi']) -> pd.DataFrame:

Not preferred (multi-line):
    def parse_video_folder(
        cls,
        folder_path: Path,
        video_extensions: List[str] = ['.mp4', '.avi']
    ) -> pd.DataFrame:

Only split function signatures across multiple lines when absolutely necessary due to length constraints.
